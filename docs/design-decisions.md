# Design Decisions

## Architecture Overview

The Inventory Management API is built with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and reliability. Here are the key architectural decisions and their rationales:

## Technology Stack

- **Flask**: Chosen for its lightweight nature and flexibility in building RESTful APIs
- **PostgreSQL**: Selected for its robustness in handling complex transactions and relationships
- **SQLAlchemy**: Used as ORM for better database abstraction and management
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent development and deployment environments

## Key Features and Implementation Details

### RESTful API Design
- Follows REST principles for predictable and standard API behavior
- Uses proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Implements pagination for better performance with large datasets

### Real-time Inventory Tracking
- Immediate updates on inventory movements
- Transactional integrity for all inventory operations
- Detailed audit trail for tracking changes

### Security Considerations
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Transaction isolation for concurrent operations
- Proper error handling and logging

### Low Stock Alerts
- Automated monitoring of inventory levels
- Configurable threshold settings
- Notification system for low stock conditions

### Data Model Design
- Normalized database schema for efficient data management
- Proper relationships between products, stores, and inventory
- Audit trails for tracking all changes

## Future Considerations

- Potential implementation of caching for frequently accessed data
- Scaling strategies for handling increased load
- API versioning strategy
- Integration with external systems
